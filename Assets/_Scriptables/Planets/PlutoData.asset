  Info: "Pluto is a complex and mysterious world with mountains, valleys, plains,
    craters, and glaciers. It is located in the distant Kuiper Belt.\r\n\r\nDiscovered
    in 1930, Pluto was long considered our solar system's ninth planet. But after
    the discovery of similar intriguing worlds deeper in the Kuiper Belt, tiny Pluto
    was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 by the International Astronomical
    Union.\r\n\r\nPluto is only about 1,400 miles wide. At that small size, Pluto
    is only about half the width of the United States. It's about 3.6 billion miles
    away from the Sun, and it has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of nitrogen,
    methane, and carbon monoxide. On average, Pluto\u2019s temperature is -387\xB0F
    (-232\xB0C), making it too cold to sustain life.\r\n\r\nPluto is orbited by five
    known moons, the largest of which is Charon. Charon is about half the size of
    Pluto itself, making it the largest satellite relative to the planet it orbits
    in our solar system. Pluto and Charon are often referred to as a \"double planet.\"\r\n\r\nThe
    only spacecraft to explore Pluto up close was NASA's New Horizons. It flew by
    the dwarf planet and its moons in 2015."
