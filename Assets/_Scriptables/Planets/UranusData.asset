  Info: 'Uranus is a very cold and windy world. The ice giant is surrounded by 13
    faint rings and 28 small moons. Uranus rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from
    the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin sideways,
    orbiting the Sun like a rolling ball.

    

    Uranus was the first planet
    found with the aid of a telescope. It was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William
    Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star. It
    was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet,
    in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode.'
