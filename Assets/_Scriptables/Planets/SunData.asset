  Info: "The Sun's gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything \u2013
    from the biggest planets to the smallest particles of debris \u2013 in its orbit.
    The connection and interactions between the Sun and Earth drive the seasons,
    ocean currents, weather, climate, radiation belts and auroras. Though it is special
    to us, there are billions of stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way
    galaxy.\r\n\r\nThe Sun has many names in many cultures. The Latin word for Sun
    is \u201Csol,\u201D which is the main adjective for all things Sun-related: solar."
