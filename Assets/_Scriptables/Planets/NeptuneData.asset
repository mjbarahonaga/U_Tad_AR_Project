  Info: 'Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is more than
    30 times as far from the Sun as Earth. Neptune is the only planet in our solar
    system not visible to the naked eye. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year
    orbit since its discovery in 1846.

    

    Neptune is so far from the Sun
    that high noon on the big blue planet would seem like dim twilight to us. The
    warm light we see here on our home planet is roughly 900 times as bright as sunlight
    on Neptune.'
