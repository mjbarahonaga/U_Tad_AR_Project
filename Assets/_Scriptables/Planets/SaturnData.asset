  Info: 'Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen
    and helium. Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular
    or as complex as Saturn''s. Saturn also has dozens of moons.

    

    From
    the jets of water that spray from Saturn''s moon Enceladus to the methane lakes
    on smoggy Titan, the Saturn system is a rich source of scientific discovery and
    still holds many mysteries.'
